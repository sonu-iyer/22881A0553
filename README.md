This project is a modern React.js-based URL Shortener web application that allows users to shorten long URLs, optionally set an expiry time in minutes, view a list of shortened URLs, track redirection statistics locally using localStorage, and handle real-time redirection via React Router. Built using React.js, React Router v6, and Material UI, the app has a clean, responsive interface. The application consists of three main components: url.js for shortening URLs, statistics.js for displaying usage data, and redirect.js for redirecting to long URLs using shortcodes. All data is stored in the browser using localStorage, so no backend is required. To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and start the development server using npm start. The app will run on http://localhost:3000. Future improvements could include backend integration, QR code generation, analytics tracking, and user authentication. The project is licensed under the MIT License.
